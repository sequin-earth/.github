# Welcome to sequin.earth!

*Sequin* is my forever passion project, but it’s on a brief hiatus. More info is available at the [sequin.earth project page](https://sequin.earth). 

Don’t worry - this isn’t a sunset, just a disco nap. Sequin is coming back, but in the meantime, I’m working on something with [#beachyvibesonly](https://beachhouse.dev/) in mind. 

For inquiries, please reach out to product@sequin.earth or ping the artist behind the project, [Christian Van de Werken](https://werken.com/bio).
